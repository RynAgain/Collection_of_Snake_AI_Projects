# Collection of Snake AI Projects

A collection of various AI projects I made involving the game Snake. Each one has a unique version of the game that I made from scratch. I would just do this when I was bored.

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of Snake game projects where I implemented different versions of the game logic and added AI on top of it. These projects were created as a fun way to practice coding and explore AI concepts.

## Project Descriptions

### Snake Game
- **Description**: A basic implementation of the classic Snake game with a simple AI.
- **Features**: Basic pathfinding and UI elements.

### Snake Game 2 Py
- **Description**: A Python version of the Snake game with enhanced AI capabilities.
- **Features**: Improved AI logic and high score tracking.

### Snake Invader
- **Description**:  classic Space Invaders.
- **Features**: Includes enemy sprites and a more complex game environment.
- Not a snake game and no AI features but still.  Didn't do much with it other than an hour of programing 

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the specific setup instructions for each project.

## Features

- Unique game logic for each project.
- Various AI implementations to control the snake.
- Fun and engaging gameplay.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance AI strategies for better performance.
- Add more levels and challenges.
- Improve graphics and user interface.

## Acknowledgments

These projects were inspired by classic games and various online resources that helped me learn and implement AI techniques.
